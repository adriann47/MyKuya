How to Run MyKuya
-Using an android emulator or a browser, run flutter project. Open app and log-in your account (register account if you are a new user).
Homepage - this is the landing page of MyKuya, errands will be displayed here and an addErrand function available, as well as a search bar to filter errands by their type.
Kuyapage- this is where you can specifically hire kuyas to do tasks for you.
Clicking any item on the Homepage and Kuyapage will initiate a popup dialog with actions such as accept errand or hire kuya.
History/Errands list- this is where the errands you accepted will be displayed. Clicking an item here will allow you to cancel or complete an errand. Once you changed an errand's status, it will no longer be clickable.
Profile/Wallet page- this is where you can see the e-wallet feature. There is a built-in deposit function which simulates deposit. Completing an errand from the History/Errands list tab will let you earn money which will go straight to your wallet. Hiring a kuya will cost you money which will be deducted from your balance. If you have no balance, the transaction will fail and an error message will pop up.
